=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::StandardText - Methods used within ExtUtils::ModuleMaker

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The methods described below are 'quasi-private' methods which are called by
the publicly available methods of ExtUtils::ModuleMaker and
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Interactive.  They are 'quasi-private' in the sense
that they are not intended to be called by the everyday user of
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.  Nothing prevents a user from calling these
methods, but they are documented here primarily so that users
writing plug-ins for ExtUtils::ModuleMaker's standard text will know what methods
need to be subclassed.

The methods below are called in C<ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::complete_build()>
but not in that same package's C<new()>.  For methods called in
C<new()>, please see ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Initializers.

The descriptions below are presented in hierarchical order rather than
alphabetically.  The order is that of ''how close to the surface can a
particular method called?'', where 'surface' means being called within
C<ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::complete_build()>.
So methods called within C<complete_build()> are described before
methods which are only called within other quasi-private methods.  Some of the
methods described are also called within ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Interactive
methods.  And some quasi-private methods are called within both public and
other quasi-private methods.  Within each heading, methods are presented more
or less as they are first called within the public or higher-order
quasi-private methods.

Happy subclassing!

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Methods Called within C<complete_build()>

=head3 C<create_base_directory>

  Usage     : $self->create_base_directory within complete_build()
  Purpose   : Create the directory where all the files will be created.
  Returns   : $DIR = directory name where the files will live
  Argument  : n/a
  Comment   : $self keys Base_Dir, COMPACT, NAME.  Calls method create_directory.

=cut

sub create_base_directory {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->{Base_Dir} = File::Spec->rel2abs(
      join( ( $self->{COMPACT} ) ? q{-} : q{/}, split( /::/, $self->{NAME} ) )
    );

    $self->create_directory( $self->{Base_Dir} );
}

=head3 C<create_directory()>

  Usage     : create_directory( [ I<list of directories to be built> ] )
              in complete_build; create_base_directory; create_pm_basics
  Purpose   : Creates directory(ies) requested.
  Returns   : n/a
  Argument  : Reference to an array holding list of directories to be created.
  Comment   : Essentially a wrapper around File::Path::mkpath.  Will use
              values in $self keys VERBOSE and PERMISSIONS to provide
              2nd and 3rd arguments to mkpath if requested.
  Comment   : Adds to death message in event of failure.

=cut

sub create_directory {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->death_message( [ "Can't create a directory: $!" ] );
}

=head3 C<print_file()>

  Usage     : $self->print_file($filename, $filetext) within complete_build()
  Purpose   : Adds the file being created to MANIFEST, then prints text to new
              file.  Logs file creation under verbose.  Adds info for
              death_message in event of failure.
  Returns   : n/a
  Argument  : 2 arguments: filename and text to be printed
  Comment   :

=cut

sub print_file {
    my ( $self, $filename, $filetext ) = @_;

    push( @{ $self->{MANIFEST} }, $filename )
      unless ( $filename eq 'MANIFEST' );
    $self->log_message( qq{writing file '$filename'});

    my $file = File::Spec->catfile( $self->{Base_Dir}, $filename );
    open my $FILE, '>', $file or

You can create it now by using the command shown above from this directory.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

=head3 C<block_subroutine_header()>

  Usage     : $self->block_subroutine_header($module) within text_pm_file()
  Purpose   : Composes an inline comment for pm file (much like this inline
              comment) which documents purpose of a subroutine
  Returns   : String containing text for inline comment
  Argument  : $module: pointer to the module being built
              (as there can be more than one module built by EU::MM);
              for the primary module it is a pointer to $self
  Throws    : n/a
  Comment   : This method is a likely candidate for alteration in a subclass
              E.g., some may prefer this info to appear in POD rather than
              inline comments.
