Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.

0.3613 August 28, 2005
    - To preclude the problems experienced by Alex and Marc in the future, I
      modified one sub in ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Utility and created another. 
     _get_personal_defaults_directory() was modified to return a flag which,
if true, indicates that no $HOME/.modulemaker was found on the system at the
beginning of a given block of tests.  _restore_personal_dir_status() was then
created to take note of this flag at the end of a given block of tests and, if
such a directory had been created during the testing process, removing it so
that the user's system status is ultimately unchanged.  This required
modification of every test file and (for t/02 and t/13) two subroutines in
t/testlib/Auxiliary.pm, as well as to calls to
_get_personal_defaults_directory in ModuleMaker.pm.

0.3612 August 28, 2005
    - Alex Gill continued to report problems with t/06, t/07 and t/18.  He
      sent me the output for all three.  I realized that the problem with t/06
and t/07 was that, not having Module::Build installed on his system, the SKIP
block was being activated -- but I had left one test (for changing back to the
original directory)  outside the SKIP block at the end of these files.  So the
harness was reporting a number of tests run different from that calculated at
the beginning of the SKIP block.  I moved this test back inside the SKIP block
in these files -- as well as in t/03, t/04, t/05.
    - Marc Prewitt reported the same problem with t/18 that Alex did, though
      he was running Perl 5.6 on Linux and Solaris.  Problem has to do with
the ability to create a directory for Personal::Defaults.  After taking a
crash course in File::Path and File::Spec, I think I have corrected the
problem with make_selections_defaults().

0.3611 August 27, 2005
    - Alex Gill reported problems while testing t/06, t/07 and t/18.  I
      couldn't reproduce the problems with t/06 and t/07 (at first) and asked
Alex to re-run those tests with 'prove'.  With t/18, I realized that I had not
tested for the possibility that a user would not already have a
$HOME/.modulemaker directory installed on his/her system.  So I refactored
code in ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Utility into two distinct subroutines, with
_get_home_directory() establishing a .modulemaker directory and
_get_personal_defaults_directory establishing the directory that will hold
Personal::Defaults.  Sent this version back to same 7 people for further
testing.

0.3610 August 27, 2005
    - Completed work to get modulemaker to work in interactive mode.  Sent
      this version to 7 people for beta testing.

0.3609 August 27, 2005
    - Created make_selections_defaults() method.  It works so far in scripts
      and in modulemaker non-interactive mode.

0.3608 August 25, 2005
    - Test suite can now detect presence of Personal::Defaults file in
      appropriate place on system and work around it during testing.

0.3607 August 19, 2005
    - Much work, but particularly important was the elimination of %AUTHOR in
      favor of 5 top-level keys.

0.3606 August 16, 2005
	- Fixing interactive mode.

0.3605 August 13, 2005

0.3604 July 31, 2005
	- Adapted test suite so that it will run (albeit skipping most
	  tests) on versions of Perl < 5.6.

0.3603 July 23, 2005
        - Intermediate version not released to CPAN.  Starting to move
          standard copy to Defaults::standard_text(). Realized that
block_final_one() was making no use of $module, so eliminated $module
from sub's argument list.  Similarly, realized that block_new_method()
was making no use of $module, so eliminated it from the sub's argument
list.

0.3602 July 22, 2005
        - Intermediate version not released to CPAN.  After much sweat,
          moved sub default_values() to new package
lib/ExtUtils/ModuleMaker/Defaults.pm.
        - Created sub failsafe() as testing subroutine for
          t/02_bad_constructor.t.
        - Corrected one misspecified test in t/03_quick.t.

0.36 July 18, 2005
        - Corrected error pointed out by CPAN tester Scott R. Godin:
          IO::Capture and subclasses were omitted from MANIFEST, 
          causing failure in t/11_miscargs.t.
        - Added additional command-line option '-q' to suppress sub new() 
          in .pm file created by modulemaker.  Added tests to t/09_mmkr.t 
          to test suppression of POD and suppression of sub new() in 
          .pm file created by modulemaker.  Along the way, wrote 
          additional testing subroutines and added them to 
          t/testlib/_Auxiliary.pm:
               exported:  check_pm_file make_compact
               not exported:  pod_present constructor_present
        - Typographic cleanup of what modulemaker prints to STDOUT for 
          Directives menu (mistake caused by my wrap settings in vi).
        - Commented out SecondStyles.pm so it will no longer be bundled 
          via make dist and no longer be uploaded to CPAN.

0.35 July 17, 2005
	- Removed support for Perl 4 style module names (e.g., D'oh).
	- Added many tests, including tests for the modulemaker utility
	  in non-interactive mode.
	- Extensive refactoring, including extraction of most variable 
          and subroutine declarations from modulemaker utility and 
          placed them in lib/ExtUtils/ModuleMaker/Interactive.pm.  
          Done to simplify future maintenance and make coverage results 
          more transparent.
	- Added partial_dump() method to ModuleMaker.pm.  This is not
	  yet viewed as publicly available but is used to diagnose the
          content of the EUMM object during development.
	- Improvements in documentation; more to come.

0.34    - Intermediate version not released to CPAN.

0.33 July 8, 2005
	- Primary maintenance taken over by James E Keenan
	  (jkeenan@cpan.org).
        - scripts/modulemaker
	  - modulemaker utility revised with objective of making it
	    possible to specify all options on the command-line
          - Included ABSTRACT in Main Menu and created prompt for new abstract
          - Allowed for additional command-line options for specification 
            of abstract and author info
          - Modified Usage message to reflect additional command-line 
            options; placed options in alphabetical order
        - lib/ExtUtils/ModuleMaker.pm:
          - Corrected typing errors in several places
          - Modified ORGANIZATION in POD to parallel wording of CPANID
          - Changed $defaults{ABSTRACT} to 'Module abstract 
            (<= 44 characters) goes here'
          - Allowed for ORGANIZATION, where defined, to be included in 
            AUTHOR COMPOSITE and thereby included in Author section of POD
	  - Fixed Block_Begin() and Block_Begin_BareBones() to eliminate 
            blank first line in .pm files
	  - Deletion of superseded/deprecated subroutines and
            corresponding POD
        - t/*.t
	  - Corrected names of test files on first lines of each of 
            02_simple.t, 03_quick.t and 04_compact.t
          - Created 05_abstract. to test current and new features:
              -- correct Author and Email in Makefile.PL
              -- placement of Abstract in POD
              -- placement of Author info in POD
              -- placement of History info in POD rather than in Changes
          - Created t/06_build.t and t/07_proxy.t to test alternative
            BUILD_SYSTEMs
	  - Created t/08_modulemaker.t to pave the way for testing of
	    the modulemaker utility (much to be done)

--------------------------------------------------------------

0.32 June 16 2003 (YAPC::Boca_Raton)
	- Removed Fakefile.PL that was for testing but only caused
	  problems.  The content has been held over after __END__
	  in Makefile.PL
	- Added missing fullname for libpng license which was causing
	  an odd number of parts in a hash
	- Added support for Module::Build (patch from Dave Rolsky)
	- Fixed misplaced backslash when generating the new method
	- Generated Makefile.PL now has a prerequisite of Test::Simple

	- Complete rewrite from the ground up for the 0.3xxx line
	- Created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.202
	- Now object oriented for customizability
	- Licenses in two new modules:
