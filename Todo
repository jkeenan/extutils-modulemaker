User can now save selections as new defaults either (a) as explicit method
call within a program; (b) as command-line option provided to modulemaker; or
(c) as choice made at modulemaker prompt.

Projects still outstanding:
1.  Testing of modulemaker interactive mode.  I wasn't able to apply
Expect::Simple successfully to this task.  It wasn't capturing the text
printed to STDOUT at program launch, nor was it capturing the final text so
printed.  And it gave different results with new invocations of a given test
file.  So, other than my own idiosyncratic testing, the interactive mode is
untested.

2.  Ways to easily subclass StandardText.
